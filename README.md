# QR Code Component by Pious Alpha

This challenge includes a sleek and contemporary QR code component that is aimed to improve the functioning of any website. This component was created in response to a Frontend Mentor challenge and demonstrates my competence in web development. The component's clean and basic design fits smoothly into any site and delivers a straightforward user experience. Aside from its visual attractiveness, the component has been designed with accessibility in mind, including several ARIA features for both keyboard and auditory accessibility. Whether the goal is to increase the operation of my personal blog or to add a useful element to a corporate website, this QR code component is certain to suit a variety of requirements.

## Features
> 1. The component's header contains a link to the Frontend Mentor website, as well as a link to my Github profile. The component's primary content area is divided into two sections: a barcode container and a text container. The barcode container has a QR code picture, while the text container contains a headline and a paragraph of text.

> 2. The component is designed to be accessible, with the use of various ARIA attributes, such as tabindex, role, aria-label, and aria-labelledby. These attributes aid in providing context and information to assistive technologies, and ensure that the website can be easily navigated using a keyboard.
